.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR
opens the log journal for reading\&. It will find all journal files automatically and interleave them automatically when reading\&. As first argument it takes a pointer to a
sd_journal
pointer, which on success will contain journal context object afterwards\&. The second argument is a flags field, which may consist of the following flags ORed together:
SD_JOURNAL_LOCAL_ONLY
makes sure only journal files generated on the local machine will be opened\&.
SD_JOURNAL_RUNTIME_ONLY
makes sure only volatile journal files will be opened, excluding those which are stored on persistent storage\&.
SD_JOURNAL_SYSTEM_ONLY
will ensure that only journal files of system services and the kernel (in opposition to user session processes) will be opened\&.
.PP
\fBsd_journal_open_directory()\fR
is similar to
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR
but takes an absolute directory path as argument\&. All journal files in this directory will be opened and interleaved automatically\&. This call also takes a flags argument, but it must be passed as 0 as no flags are currently understood for this call\&.
.PP
\fBsd_journal_close()\fR
will close the journal context allocated with
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR
or
\fBsd_journal_open_directory()\fR
and free its resources\&.
.PP
When opening the journal only journal files accessible to the calling user will be opened\&. If journal files are not accessible to the caller this will be silently ignored\&.
.PP
See
\fBsd_journal_next\fR(3)
for an example how to iterate through the journal after opening it with
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR\&.
.PP
A journal context object returned by
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR
references a specific journal entry as
\fIcurrent\fR
entry, similar to a file seek index in a classic file system file, but without absolute positions\&. It may be altered with
\fBsd_journal_next\fR(3)
and
\fBsd_journal_seek_head\fR(3)
and related calls\&. The current entry position may be exported in
\fIcursor\fR
strings, as accessible via
\fBsd_journal_get_cursor\fR(3)\&. Cursor strings may be used to globally identify a specific journal entry in a stable way and then later to seek to it (or if the specific entry is not available locally, to its closest entry in time)
\fBsd_journal_seek_cursor\fR(3)\&.
.PP
Notification of journal changes is available via
\fBsd_journal_get_fd()\fR
and related calls\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR
and
\fBsd_journal_open_directory()\fR
calls return 0 on success or a negative errno\-style error code\&.
\fBsd_journal_close()\fR
returns nothing\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The
\fBsd_journal_open()\fR,
\fBsd_journal_open_directory()\fR
and
\fBsd_journal_close()\fR
interfaces are available as shared library, which can be compiled and linked to with the
libsystemd\-journal
\fBpkg-config\fR(1)
file\&.
